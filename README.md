Hourglass is a menu-bar Pomodoro tool with custom controls to select your focus and rest time-blocks.

- No distractions, no pausing, no bloat. Commit to focus for the duration of the timer. 
- Customize your timer presets. A break is suggested, and then forced, after a set amount of focus time.
- View your completed time-block history in an interactive chart.

This is for folks who agree that traditional Pomodoro technique is too rigid. 
Need a bigger time-block for your task? Take it. Want a shorter rest period? Go ahead. 
You choose how to manage your time, and Hourglass will remind you to take a break before getting back to work.
